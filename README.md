MAlice Compiler
====

The MAlice Compiler project was a group project that ran throughout the autumn term of our second year at Imperial (2010). The group size was three. It was split into several key milestones, each milestone representing a significant stage of the design and implementation process.

Milestone 1 required our group to determine a specification of our compiler for the basics of the Alice language. We were required to decide how we would interpret the Alice language and what rules our compiler would adhere to. Milestone 2 required the group to build a working compiler for the basic specification. This laid out the framework for a more complex compiler to be built in Milestone 3 that was capable of compiling programs written using the complete Alice language.
